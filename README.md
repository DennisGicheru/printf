# Team Project to create our own Printf function                                                                                                       

                                                                                                                                                       

This project is a collaboration between Steve Ramoya and Dennis Gicheru where a function named printf is created and is supposed to imitate the actual 

printf function found in stdio.h                                                                                                                       

                                                                                                                                                       

our-printf is used to format and print a series of characters and values to the standard output to the standard output. Its prototype is:              

 int _printf(const char *format, ...);                                                                                                                 

                                                                                                                                                       

## Task 0- write a function that produces output according to a function                                                                               

                                                                                                                                                       

## Task 1-Handle convertion specifiers; d, i
